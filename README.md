# Representation-adjusted Average Treatment Effects (RATEs)

This repository contains source code for estimating RATEs and related simulations. Additional detail is available in the manuscript *Quantifying and reducing the impact of disparities in sample representation*.

Simulation files can be run from main.R

RATEs can be estimated from estRATE.R
