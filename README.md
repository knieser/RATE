# Representation-adjusted Average Treatment Effects (RATEs)

This repository contains source code for estimating RATEs and related simulations. Additional detail is available in [Quantifying and reducing inequity in average treatment effect estimation]( https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-023-02104-2 "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-023-02104-2").

Simulation files can be run from main.R

RATEs can be estimated from estRATE.R
